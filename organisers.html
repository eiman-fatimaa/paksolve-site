         A grid of cards — one card per organiser.
         CSS grid/flexbox in styles.css makes these sit side by side

         To add a new organiser: copy one entire <article> block and paste it.
         To remove one: delete one entire <article> block.

        <div class="organisers-grid"> is the CONTAINER for all the cards.

          Perfect for profile cards, blog posts, news items.

          class="organiser-card card" applies TWO classes at once (space-separated):
            - "card" = the general white box style (shared with index.html cards)

          <!--
            <img> = image tag. It's a self-closing tag (no </img> needed).

            src="images/organisers/organiser1.jpg"
              = path to the image file.
              This means there should be a folder called "images",
              inside it a folder called "organisers",
              inside that a file called "organiser1.jpg".
              To add a real photo: upload the photo to that folder in your repo
              and update this src path to match the filename.

            alt="Organiser 1"
              = alternative text shown if the image fails to load.
              Also read aloud by screen readers for visually impaired users.
              Replace "Organiser 1" with the person's actual name.

            class="organiser-image"
              = CSS styles for sizing/shaping the photo (e.g. circular, fixed width).

            loading="lazy"
              = the image only loads when the user scrolls near it.
              This makes the page load faster — especially useful when there are many images.

            onerror="this.src='https://placehold.co/...'"
              = JavaScript that runs IF the image fails to load.
              "this" refers to this <img> element.
              "this.src = ..." replaces the broken image with a grey placeholder.
              So instead of a broken image icon, users see a grey box that says "Photo".
              You can delete this line once you have real photos.

          Replace "Organiser Name 1" with the actual person's name.
          class="organiser-name" lets CSS style names specifically (e.g. bold, teal color).
