      <h2>What is PakSolve?</h2>
      <p>The Pakistan STEM Problem Solving Talent Hunt (PakSolve) is a free virtual program for curious, ambitious Pakistani students interested in high-quality Math and Science education. At PakSolve, you will be taught by MIT students and Pakistanis who have won medals at the International Physics and Math Olympiads. By joining, you’ll become part of a community of like-minded Pakistani students, where you can learn together and collaborate to solve fun, challenging problems.</p>

      <h2>PakSolve's Mission</h2>
      <p>It's no secret that Pakistan is behind the rest of the world in innovation. At the same time, people often say that Pakistani students have incredible potential. This is both true and not true. An average Pakistani student is not naturally smarter than an average student in Japan, for example. But they are also not less capable. Yet, the best students in Pakistan lag far behind the best students abroad. This shows that Pakistani students are not given enough incentives or resources to reach their full potential.

Every organizer and instructor at PakSolve has won medals at the International Physics or Math Olympiads representing Pakistan. This gives us a unique perspective on the kind of learning environment we would have benefited from during our O Level or Matric years. Through this program, we aim to achieve two main goals:
      1. Encouraging Self-Learning

Learning to study independently is a vital skill for any student. If you do not take charge of your education, learn at your own pace, and spend extra time on subjects you are passionate about, you will be held back by our mediocre education system.

We want to give students in Pakistan who show a spark in STEM the push to explore their interests in Science and Math. Through rigorous Math and Physics courses, we hope to help them start their journey as self-directed learners and take charge of their own education.

2. Creating Future Innovators

For a program like this, the reality is: out of every 100 students given a push, roughly 70 will attend the first class, 40 will continue after three weeks, 15 will put in enough effort to learn all the material, and 7 or 8 will go above and beyond. These few students will become lifelong learners, dedicating the rest of their high school years to deeply understanding Math and Physics.

Beyond motivating a large number of students, we hope to inspire a smaller group of highly motivated, hardworking students who will become Pakistan’s future innovators and scientists. These students may also represent Pakistan in International Science Olympiads.</p>

      <h2>PakSolve Fellowship</h2>
      <p>In order to succeed in goal (2), a small cohort of you will be admitted to the PakSolve Fellowship. This will mean a few things. Firstly, you will be given exponentially more direct, one on one attention during this program. This direct attention will also mean that you will have room to personalise your study with PakSolve as we will be able to mold our syllabus to the specific likings and needs of Fellowship members. Secondly, we will continue to work with students who make it into the fellowship throughout their high school careers, and provide them with amazing opportunities like representing Pakistan in the International Math, Physics or Informatics Olympiads. Getting into the fellowship is a gateway into opportunities in Math, Physics and Computer Science and connections with some of today's most successful young Pakistanis.</p>
      <p>Getting into the Fellowship DOES NOT depend only on how good you are at Math. It will be based on demonstrated effort and enthusiasm for the course as well as how much progress and mathematical growth you show throughout the program. The rationale behind this decision is to make getting into the fellowship fair for younger students and for people who enter this program with less background knowledge. If you are someone who is really good and ahead of your year group at Math and Physics: don't worry, your prior knowledge will still help you qualify, (we are looking for talent after all and it would be stupid to not try to enroll very gifted students) it just won't guarantee entry into the Fellowship without hard work and effort, and students who come into the program with less prior knowledge will be given ample opportunities to demonstrate progress and qualify with just as much certainty as you.</p>

      <h2>Expectations We Have for You</h2>
      <p>This program will begin over the summer. There are some requirements to join.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>You have to be willing to work very hard. This program will give you amazing resources and exposure and the chance to develop problem solving skills that will serve you for your entire future careers. However, in order to actually benefit from the material, putting in the hours to struggle through the problems and material is a must. The problem sets for our program will not be trivial, algorithmic and computational like your school homework; they will be tough, require creative problem solving and sufficient effort to solve. We highly encourage you to apply to this program, but please only do so with the intention to work hard to learn some high level Math and Physics over this summer.</li>
        <li>You MUST be a student in the 8th, 9th or 10th grade or younger if you are a Matric student or a student in the 9th, 10th or 11th grade or younger if you are an O level student in order to apply to PakSolve. If you don't meet this grade requirement, please do not try to join the program as it is not for you, and you will be promptly removed once we ask for proof of grade. We may accept enthusiastic younger students who wish to join if they demonstrate sufficient knowledge to keep up with the material, but we will under no circumstances accept students who are in higher grades than the ones mentioned above.</li>
        <li>Attendance is very important. Lectures will be online and you must only miss them under exceptional circumstances. Attendance and participation will be the prime factor in selection into the PakSolve Fellowship.</li>
      </ol>
