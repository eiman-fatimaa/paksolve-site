          The Pakistan STEM Problem Solving Talent Hunt (PakSolve for short) is a free virtual program
          for curious, ambitious Pakistani students who are interested in gaining a high-quality
          education in Math and Science. At PakSolve, you will be instructed by MIT students and
          Pakistanis who have won medals at the International Physics and Math Olympiads.
          By signing up, you will become part of a large community of similarly ambitious Pakistani
          students so that you can all learn together and collaborate to solve fun, challenging problems.

      <!-- CARD 2: PakSolve's Mission -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>PakSolve's Mission</h2>
        <p>
          It's no secret that Pakistan is very behind the rest of the world in innovation. At the same time, people constantly claim that Pakistani students have crazy high potential. This is both true and not true. It is unlikely that an average Pakistani student is born innately smarter than an average student in Japan for example. But it's also true that our Pakistani students aren't innately dumber than students anywhere else. Yet, the best students in Pakistan are far behind the best students abroad. This is evidence of the fact that students in Pakistan are not being given enough incentives or resources to live up to their intellectual potential. 
          Every Organiser and instructor at PakSolve has won something at the International Physics or Math olympiads representing Pakistan and hence we are uniquely positioned to look back and think about what kind of learning environment we ourselves would have benefited from during our O level/ Matric years. Through making this program happen, we hope to achieve two central goals: 
        </p>

        <ol>
          <!--
            <ol> = Ordered List = a NUMBERED list (1, 2, 3...)
            Use <ol> when the ORDER matters.
            Use <ul> (unordered list) when order doesn't matter — that gives bullet points.
          -->

          <li>
            <!--
              <li> = List Item = one item in the list.
              Each point goes inside its own <li> tag.
            -->
            Self learning is a vital skill to learn early on as a student. If you don't take personal charge of your education and start learning on your own, at your own pace, and devoting extra time to ideas and subjects you are passionate about, you will always be pulled down by our very mediocre education system. We want to give a large number of students in Pakistan who demonstrate a spark in STEM a push to work on their interests in Science and Math by learning some relevant, rigorous Math and Physics and to launch their journeys on self learning and taking charge of their education.
          </li>

          <li>
            Inevitably, the reality of a program like this is that for every 100 students who are given a push to develop their interest in Science or Math, 70 will attend the first day of classes, 40 will continue to attend 3 weeks in, 15 will put in enough effort to learn all the course material, and 7 or 8 will go above and beyond and continue to become life long learners, devoting the rest of their high school years to deeply learning Math and Physics. Not only do we want to motivate a large number of students as described in goal (1), we also hope to inspire the creation of a smaller cohort of these ultra motivated, hard working students who will go on to become Pakistan's future innovators and scientists and will be able to represent our Country in International Science Olympiads.

      <!-- CARD 3: PakSolve Fellowship -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>PakSolve Fellowship</h2>
        <p>
          In order to succeed in goal (2), a small cohort of you will be admitted to the PakSolve Fellowship. This will mean a few things. Firstly, you will be given exponentially more direct, one on one attention during this program. This direct attention will also mean that you will have room to personalise your study with PakSolve as we will be able to mold our syllabus to the specific likings and needs of Fellowship members. Secondly, we will continue to work with students who make it into the fellowship throughout their high school careers, and provide them with amazing opportunities like representing Pakistan in the International Math, Physics or Informatics Olympiads. Getting into the fellowship is a gateway into opportunities in Math, Physics and Computer Science and connections with some of today's most successful young Pakistanis.
        </p>
        <p>
          <!-- A second paragraph inside the same card — just use another <p> tag -->
          Getting into the Fellowship DOES NOT depend only on how good you are at Math. It will be based on demonstrated effort and enthusiasm for the course as well as how much progress and mathematical growth you show throughout the program. The rationale behind this decision is to make getting into the fellowship fair for younger students and for people who enter this program with less background knowledge. If you are someone who is really good and ahead of your year group at Math and Physics: don't worry, your prior knowledge will still help you qualify, (we are looking for talent after all and it would be stupid to not try to enroll very gifted students) it just won't guarantee entry into the Fellowship without hard work and effort, and students who come into the program with less prior knowledge will be given ample opportunities to demonstrate progress and qualify with just as much certainty as you.

          This program will begin over the summer. There are some requirements to join. 
        </p>
        <ol>
          <!-- Numbered list again because these are specific requirements -->

          <li>
            You have to be willing to work very hard. This program will give you amazing resources and exposure and the chance to develop problem solving skills that will serve you for your entire future careers. However, in order to actually benefit from the material, putting in the hours to struggle through the problems and material is a must. The problem sets for our program will not be trivial, algorithmic and computational like your school homework; they will be tough, require creative problem solving and sufficient effort to solve. We highly encourage you to apply to this program, but please only do so with the intention to work hard to learn some high level Math and Physics over this summer. 
          </li>

          <li>
            You MUST be a student in the 8th, 9th or 10th grade or younger if you are a Matric student or a student in the 9th, 10th or 11th grade or younger if you are an O level student in order to apply to PakSolve. If you don't meet this grade requirement, please do not try to join the program as it is not for you, and you will be promptly removed once we ask for proof of grade. We may accept enthusiastic younger students who wish to join if they demonstrate sufficient knowledge to keep up with the material, but we will under no circumstances accept students who are in higher grades than the ones mentioned above.
          </li>

          <li>
            Attendance is very important. Lectures will be online and you must only miss them under exceptional circumstances. Attendance and participation will be the prime factor in selection into the PakSolve Fellowship.
